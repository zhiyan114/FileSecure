# FileSecure

## About
This is an upgrade from FileSecure v3 with major improvement and maybe some inconvience xD.
This software is completed and tested.

## Features
* Mass File or Single File encryption/decryption.
* AES-256-GCM Encryption Method (known to be the most secure at this time)
* Light-Weighted (very little memory/disk space consumption is required for the software)
* Multi-threading for mass file encryption/decryption to process all the files at the same time (speed is limited on your disk unless your using an old CPU)
* Supported nearly all file-size
## Additional Informations
This software requires visual studio on windows. You may submit any suggestions or pull request at your own will.

There will be more comment on the source code to make it easier to understand.
